## 🧠 Core Concepts Covered (`Codes/`)

    - ✅ Variables, Datatypes, Operators
    - ✅ Pointers and Arrays
    - ✅ Strings & String Functions
    - ✅ Loops and Conditionals
    - ✅ Functions and Scope
    - ✅ File I/O Basics
    - ✅ Modular Programming
    - ✅ Command-line Compilation

These programs are self-contained and designed to demonstrate the **building blocks of C**. Each file focuses on a single concept or pattern.

## 🧪 Mini Projects (`Mini Projects/`)
    
    | Project Name               | Description                                    |
    |---------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
    | `Student_name_Manager`    | Simple CLI tool to manage student names        |
    | `Student_grade_Manager`   | Allows grade entry and average calculations    |
    | `Inventory_manager`       | Basic inventory system with file persistence   |
    
    Each of these projects was built to solve a real-world style problem using **basic logic and C fundamentals**.

## 🌟 Final Project: Fleeca Bank Manager

[Fleeca Bank GitHub Repo](<paste_link_here>)

The **Fleeca Bank Manager** is a terminal-based banking system that simulates core banking operations with a user-friendly CLI. It was built as the capstone project of my C programming journey.

    ### 🔐 Key Features:
    - Create customer accounts
    - Deposit and withdraw money
    - Display customer details
    - Save and load data from files
    
    ### 🛠️ Technical Concepts Used:
    - File handling
    - Structures and pointers
    - Modular code with header files
    - Input validation and menus

This project represents my understanding of **real-world C programming logic** applied to a system-based application.

## 📘 Notes and References
    
    - 🗒️ `C.docx`: My personal summary notes while learning C (concepts, syntax, examples).
    - 📚 `Reference Books/` folder includes:
      - _Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment – W. Richard Stevens_
      - _C Programming: A Modern Approach – K.N. King_

These PDFs helped strengthen both the fundamentals and the advanced use of C in system-level development.
